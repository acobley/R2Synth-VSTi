//------------------------------------------------------------------------
// R2Synth - custom VSTGUI controls
//
// LIFTED from ~/DXi-DEv/FilterDrum-VSTi/source/FilterDrumControls.*,
// which came from Project6, VocalFilter and SpyBand before it - the
// "interface style from the KorgDrum" this plug-in was asked to use.
//
// FOUR ADDITIONS ON THIS HOP, all opt-in, so every existing call
// behaves exactly as it did in FilterDrum:
//
//   * SpyEnvelopeView::setShowAmounts (false) hides the two Amount marker
//     lines. The LFO display has no amounts, and an ADSR's depth is its
//     curve.
//   * SpyEnvelopeView::setGateMarker (fraction) draws a dotted vertical
//     line across the plot - where the key went up on the envelope
//     display.
//   * SpyGroupBox::setTitleBand (n) draws the frame's top edge n pixels
//     DOWN the view, through the title, so the whole title is inside the
//     view. FilterDrum's boxes draw the title 5 pixels ABOVE the view,
//     where VSTGUI clips it - the top half of every title is cut off
//     there too. At 0 (the default) nothing changes.
//   * SpySelector::setCompact (true) draws the switch the SAME HEIGHT AS A
//     SLIDER'S BAR, in the same place, with the position's name where a
//     slider has its reading and the label under it where a slider has
//     its label. Without it a switch is a box nearly the full height of
//     the control, which in a row of sliders reads as a different kind of
//     panel altogether.
//
// Everything else - drawing, mouse handling, colours - is FilterDrum's
// to the line, apart from the namespace. `diff` it against FilterDrum's
// copy to see exactly that.
//
// THE CLASS NAMES ARE DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. SpySlider is still
// SpySlider, so `diff` against either of the other two copies shows only
// what genuinely differs, and a fix made in any of them can be carried to
// the others by hand. Renaming them would buy tidiness and cost that.
//
// Two things to know before editing this file:
//
//   * kValue IS NOT THE DXi's RED. The original is (192, 50, 50) and
//     SpyBand still uses it; VocalFilter changed the readouts to
//     near-white so they would not compete with a display's saturated
//     traces, and that choice is carried here. IT IS THE ONE COLOUR THAT
//     DIFFERS between the SpyBand copy and this one - keep it in mind
//     when diffing them.
//
//   * NONE OF THESE CONTROLS USES A BITMAP. The DXi property page they
//     descend from drew everything with GDI rectangles and text over the
//     panel, which is the whole reason they port at all, and why this
//     file needs no artwork in resource/. Keep any new control the same
//     way and the panel stays resolution-independent for free.

    needed 25 pixels of travel before it moved at all - see the note on
    SpySelector - so there was nothing worth carrying across. This is
    written to match their drawing conventions rather than ported from
    them: no bitmap, a 3d-rect groove, text fitted with the inherited
    drawFitted().

    UP INCREASES, which is the only sane convention for a fader and the
    opposite of what the DXi's vertical SlideSpin did. The drag is
    RELATIVE, like SpySlider's - clicking does not jump the value to the
    pointer - so a nudge is possible on a control this narrow.

    It carries a name at each END rather than one label underneath,

    SpyFader, and for a related reason: the DXi's SlideSpin put its lamp
    hard in the control's TOP-LEFT CORNER. On a 69-pixel property-page
    control that reads as a corner indicator; on a 30-pixel step switch
    it sits ten pixels left of the centred number, so a row of sixteen
    reads as a column of lamps that does not line up with the column of
    switches. That is exactly what it looked like.

    So this centres the lamp over its own switch and draws a BOX round
    the pair, which is what makes each step read as one cell rather than
    as a lamp and a switch that happen to be near each other.

/** THE ENVELOPE DISPLAY - two AR curves on one time axis.

    Taken from ForTran's FtCurveView (dark plate, caption top left,
    figure top right, fixed full scale) with one change that is the
    whole reason it exists: it holds TWO series, not one, and draws them
    against a SHARED horizontal axis.

    THE SHARED AXIS IS THE POINT. Per-curve scaling - which is what you
    get by putting two FtCurveViews side by side - would draw a 45 ms
    amp envelope and a 4 s filter envelope as the same picture, and the
    single most useful thing this display can tell you is which of the
    two outlasts the other. On a shared axis a filter release that runs
    past the amp's is a green line still descending after the red one
    has reached the floor, which is a fault you can see from across the
    room.

    BOTH CURVES ARE DRAWN FULL HEIGHT, because the curve is the SHAPE
    and the shapes are what want comparing. They were scaled by their
    Amount controls once, and it was the wrong call: the VCF Amount is
    kept low in normal use - a large one is a siren sweep, not a drum -
    so the filter envelope got drawn as a flat smear along the bottom
    edge exactly when it most needed looking at.

    THE AMOUNTS ARE TWO MARKER LINES instead, short horizontals a
    quarter of the plot wide at the height each Amount corresponds to,
    in the same colours as the curves. That keeps the amounts on the
    display without letting either of them set the scale.
