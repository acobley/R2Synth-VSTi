//------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SimpleDrum - the audio line
//
// NO SDK HEADER MAY ENTER THIS FILE OR ITS .cpp. That is deliberate, and
// there are two reasons for it.
//
//   1. It compiles and runs standalone with plain `c++ -std=c++17`, so
//      its numbers can be tested before anything is built - which
//      matters on this project, because the session that writes the code
//      reaches the Mac through a Linux VM and cannot run cmake, Xcode,
//      the SDK validator or auval at all. tests/DspTests.cpp is the only
//      thing here that actually executes during development.
//
//   2. VST3 splits the processor from the controller, and they do not
//      share memory. Anything the EDITOR displays that the DSP COMPUTES
//      must therefore come from ONE SHARED FUNCTION that both call - not
//      from two copies of the arithmetic that will drift apart. This
//      header is where those functions live: see dbToGain() below, which
//      the DSP uses to set its gain. There is no editor yet (the host's
//      generic one is used); when there is, its readouts call these too.
//
// WHAT IT DOES TODAY: nothing but render silence and apply a smoothed
// output trim. SimpleDrum is an instrument, so there is no input signal
// to pass through - render() fills the block from the voice mix, and the
// voice mix is currently empty. applyTrim() is the trim stage on its
// own, exposed so the tests can push a known block through it; that is
// the "pass-through" the blank scaffold is tested as.
//
// WHERE THE DRUM MACHINE GOES: renderVoices() is the one empty function.
// Everything else is the frame around it. Before writing a real
// processing loop in there, read ../PORTING-GUIDE.md section 5 - the
// rules about not allocating on the audio thread, denormals, 64-bit
// hosts and resisting the urge to improve the original's gain staging
// all apply to new DSP exactly as they do to a port.
